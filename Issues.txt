 1: Experimentation & Root Cause Analysis
 * Title: ðŸ”¬ Spike: Identify Root Cause of NER Memory Consumption
 * Description:
   * Observation: The NER service shows continuous memory growth.
   * Hypothesis: Potential causes include spaCy's internals, our custom post-processing logic, or other factors.
   * Goal: Run experiments using various techniques to identify the definitive root cause of the high memory consumption.
 * Acceptance Criteria:
   * An experimentation script is created to test different hypotheses.
   * The script can profile memory usage under various conditions (e.g., with/without memory zone, isolating different code paths).
   * The script generates a visual graph report for analysis.
   * A conclusive finding identifying the primary source(s) of the memory growth is documented. 2: Integrate Fix & Test in Databricks
 * Title: Integrate Fix and Test NER Pipeline in Databricks
 * Description:
   * Context: Follow-up to the investigation in [Link to Ticket 1].
   * Action: Implement the solution for the memory consumption issue based on the root cause identified in the previous spike.
   * Goal: Integrate the approved fix into the main NER pipeline and validate its effectiveness in the Databricks environment.
 * Acceptance Criteria:
   * The specific code changes required to fix the identified issue from Ticket 1 are implemented.
   * The updated NER pipeline is deployed and tested in the Databricks environment.
   * Validation testing shows stable and flat memory usage over a large dataset.
   * A final test report or graph from Databricks is attached as proof of the fix.
   * Code is reviewed and merged.
